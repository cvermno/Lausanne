# Text Difficulty Classifier Project :books:

## What is this Project? ü§î
The Text Difficulty Classifier is a machine learning project aimed at classifying text into various difficulty levels according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). 
Our model processes text excerpts from books to determine if it is suited for beginners (A1, A2), intermediate (B1, B2), or advanced (C1, C2) learners.
### A note on Text Difficulty :sweat_smile:
Language proficiency into levels A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, and C2, relies on various linguistic and structural features such as:
1. **Vocabulary** :books:
   - **Frequency and Commonality**: Texts for beginners (A1, A2) tend to use high-frequency vocabulary and common words. As the level increases, the frequency of usage decreases, and the rarity or specificity of vocabulary increases.
   - **Lexical Density**: Advanced texts (C1, C2) often have a higher density of lexical items (nouns, adjectives, adverbs, and verbs), meaning there is a greater variety of words used with fewer repetitions.

2. **Grammatical Complexity** :memo:
   - **Sentence Structure**: Basic texts use simple sentences, intermediate texts introduce compound sentences, and advanced texts use complex sentences with multiple clauses.
   - **Grammatical Features**: Advanced texts employ a wider range of verb tenses, moods (such as subjunctive), passive constructions, and conditionals.
   
3. **Conceptual Complexity and Abstractness** :bulb:
   - Topics covered in texts for higher proficiency levels often involve abstract concepts, specialized knowledge areas, and philosophical debates, as opposed to the concrete, everyday topics typically discussed in beginner texts.

4. **Cultural and Idiomatic Elements** :earth_americas:
   - Advanced texts may include idioms, cultural references, and expressions that are challenging for lower-level learners to understand without specific cultural knowledge or advanced language skills.

### Why Text Difficulty Classification is Relevant :mag:
Text difficulty classification serves not only as an educational framework but also as a guide for content creators to tailor their language appropriately across different media and platforms. Below some application ideas:

1. :mortar_board: **Educational Purposes**: to design appropriate materials, and reliable language proficiency tests.

2. :open_book: **Reader Adaptation**: to select suitable reading materials. Too easy texts won't aid learning effectively, whereas too difficult texts could demotivate learners.

4. :robot: **Automated language learning software and apps**: to automatically adjust the content on the user‚Äôs proficiency, enhancing personalized learning. 

5. :wheelchair: **Accessibility**: Ensuring content is accessible for readers of various proficiency levels, particularly in multilingual contexts.

## The Data We Used üìä
We utilized a corpus consisting of thousands of annotated sentences ranging from CEFR levels A1 to C2. These include textbooks, articles, and news feeds specifically curated to represent varied difficulty levels.

## Coding: Using Machine Learning Techniques to Classify Text Difficulty üñ•Ô∏è
Our project applies a range of ML techniques, with a focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP). We use TensorFlow and scikit-learn for preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training. Here's a snippet of our approach:
